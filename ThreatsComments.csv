23,"Webbed foot dude cracked me up omfg, and the look on that female officers face j lookin at him ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£"
24,"Is it a COs job to ask him questions about his case after heâ€™s already arrested? Every video I watch is COs antagonizing, grabbing or being rude to inmates. Why was he hovering over him in the first place when he was getting his vitals checked?"
25,Kevin hart trippin
26,"This wan not an ""intense brawl"" :D"
27,Don't bring your attitude to Las Vegas jail. They got something for you
28,That one officer let that man push his buttons so he reacted badly
29,And the stereotype continues...
30,"Sorry dude, but answering questions is pretty much a part of the deal. He voluntarily made it all into a big thing."
31,"""Did you teach me how to walk""?
 
 Well, no, but we're about to teach you how to writhe violently on the floor, using that marvelously effective teaching aid, Mr. Sparky!"

42,Officer has nice thing'ings
43,Normal day in US
44,You cant identify these criminals because they are illegal
45,"The way that police woman ran and forgot she was a cop, probably got her job only to fill the quota. She has no bussiness being a cop. Still not her fault though and i hope she recovers fully and learn from this encounter."
46,"Oh no, now sheâ€™ll have to pick up a shift (sit in the parking lot for 12 hrs) so she can pay to replace her weave."
47,"That's what your get all over the country, when Trump is president again."
48,All Feminists should see this video.
49,NY PD is the worst in the nation. They roll around like a bunch of jack boot thugs and people are getting tired of there s***.
50,Cops are getting attacked because of the corrupt sh!t they do.
51,Why is the female officer running away?leaving her colleague.
52,"the female cop ran off, do you want her to protect you"
53,OMG she runs away instead of helping the arrest .This is why it's not a woman's job .
54,New York is a liberal cesspool of $&@!!!
55,"I'm surprised the people in the comment section aren't saying ""it was self-defense"""
56,"Yeah, you have NEW YORK!!!!! The ONLY place worse than NY tgese days is Chicago!!!!!!! Imagine that!!!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾"

59,ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ why she run shes the police...do your job.
60,Garcia. Yea that sounds about right. This is what NY voted for. This is what NY gets. Ainâ€™t no sympathy.
61,And then i seen her go running
62,& she ranâ€¦. Dont make girls copsâ€¦.
63,I wouldnt wanna be a male police officer if i had a female partner that runs away when stuff happens. Men should actually quit the force and let w0men deal with it if thats gonna be the work conditions.
64,Only thing that black woman cared about was her hair
65,"Let me guess, they were ASYLUM SEEKERS!? Prayers for this poor man. This world is becoming such a ugly place anymore, heartbreaking.ðŸ™"
66,Thinking that another human with a badge should be able to dictate your life and extort you for money for doing petty things such as 80mph on the highway..Is mental illness.
67,The woman cop ran away after she got hit. Leaving her partner by himself. Unbelievable.
68,"my friend moved to NY he belived all this shit on social media about new york and shit he came back to Wisconsin broke and crackhead so fk NY and Jay,Z SONG"
69,The cop was attack
70,NYPD officer was attack
71,What the officer that the suspect could nada watch that nada that nada the knife nada nada nada that nada 78-year-old woman that the the knife nada nada nada that no keep put your hands nada nada watch nada the police officer who had nada thqt in the officer nada
72,put your hands on unarmed civilians.
73,"The guy very obviously punched first. You can hear it hit right before the officer starts punching. Iâ€™m so sick of these media people lying to everyone. In my opinion, that doesnâ€™t seem like the best way for the officer to handle that, but that doesnâ€™t mean you can lie reporter."
74," a push or a jab that the guy gave the cop just before the cop punched him? My impression is that the cop took it as a jab and felt justified in throwing punches back. You could see that it was the moment he was waiting for, when he could justifiably 'defend himself'."
75,"THE CAMERAMAN KEEPS SCREAMING ""I GOT EVERYTHING ON CAMERA!""--AS IF THE VIDEO WON'T SHOW THAT THE SUSPECT CONTINUALLY SHOVED THE OFFICER AND TRIED TO FLEE THE SCENE BEFORE GETTING PUNCHED IN THE FACE AND TURNING INTO A BABY GIRL RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET... THANKS FOR FILMING, KNUCKLEHEAD!"
76,That's better then shoot him
77,ðŸ˜® Police Abuse ðŸ˜® Intimidate the poor guy in red shirt ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®Not Right ðŸ˜®
78,Bruh the fact that the nypd police commissioner said that he didnâ€™t see anything wrong is disturbing because that man that pig threw the first punch like what do you mean
79,THE COPS GOT FIRED LOL
80,"Something tells me..... "" this is some bulls*** "" and he "" got everything on camera """
81,Does he have everything on cameraðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
82,He obviously is holding illegal substances and CNN is protecting drug dealing thieves
83,"To me itâ€™s still some bs , cop or not donâ€™t push me or hit me , yall will just let the police do anything to yâ€™all scary ass"
84,"Some of these officers I swear, and our taxes pay for their pension smh"
85,That cop was out of line and likely has anger management issues. It's like he took his personal problems that were all bundled up inside of him and just let loose on this guy to release his own tension. He should be ashamed of himself and his partner should be charged because he try hard enough to get psycho-cop off of the man.
86,"@Phil Mccracken 
 Can you show me a video (other than this because the cop resigned) of a black police officer brutalizing a black civilian."
87,"Ok this might be bad but this is really effective for cops, wrestling isn't effective against bigger people ðŸ˜‚"
88,Looked like the office was acting in self defense to me.
89,He shouldâ€™ve been fired and not given the option of resigning for that unprovoked attack on that man. Him and his partner should be arrested and charged with crimes and prosecuted to the max
90,That cop watched too much JoJo's Bizarre Adventure ðŸ’€
91,if a cop really wants to fight you he would take off his badge and duty belt ( or at least his gun) this way the law considers him not in uniform and a regular citizen so when you swing back its mutual combat they dont do that so they can swing on you and send you to jail
92,Notice how Black on Black crime dosent get Any attention in the medias? But White on Black tho
93,The other cop was like your done this is bs
94,Resigns? He was allowed to resign as opposed to being fired?
95,Resgned? He should be locked up for assault
96,That cop has target on his back now
97,they call u crazy to make u homocide
98,Citizens should have the right to protect themselves against cops
99,Black cop is the worse
100,"the bipocs always want to fight the cops until the actual second the fight starts, then its all crying ""police brutality! i have a medical condition! help help help!"" like some scared little boy"
101,They always say take your badge off and this time ol boi beat the brakes off dude
102,Wonder what department officer pillow hands is working for now.
103,Can't see any love here!
104,"Imagine if that Cop was white!
 BLM would start 3rd WW"
105,"But if anybody stepped in to stop that abuse, they would go to jail for hitting a cop"
106,Cop definitely got bullied in high school
107,The law should allow for citizens to fight back.
108,What are the intelligence requirements to become a police officer?
109,Know whats great? Can not blame the white man ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚
110,Friendly fire will not be tolerated.
111,"Its funny because now it is just a policeman who hits a guy. But if that policeman was white, than it would have been a racist thing ðŸ§"
112,Black cops are the worst to their own kind what Else is new!
113,No one hits back... THAT IS the Problem
114,Brah...for something like this to happen to youðŸ‘ˆ that's how you know the how term ðŸ”¥HOTBOYðŸ”¥came from.
115,the U.N. sentenced Bush as a War Criminal who committed genocide. that behhoves me.
116,Resigns? How about an Assault and Battery charge?
117,"Um, would BLM work for this, too? ðŸ˜‚"
118,Resign cannot make you run
119,"To be fair, if someone in pink shorts was shouting at my, i might react the same way"
120,Cop thinks he was so hard... bro know if he hit back it would get worse
121,That cop got picked on in high school
122,thanks for leaving out what started this altercation between this cop and this university student just on his way to his sick grandma...
123,I bet BLM doesn't protest this one.
124,He cannot fight lol
125,"Im black and I'm going to say it.... black cops violate black peoples rights worst than ehite cops. White cops are wrong in their interactions with black people but black cops might as well be Gestapo. Im convinced cops know the laws, they choose to ignore the laws and play dumb."
126,"Video can only be used for court.
 Showing this video is an offence."
127,black so no riots.....
128,What do you mean he got to resign??!! Wasn't he charged and jailed? Where is he now??!
129,Back to wellfare and snitchin boy
130,"Warms my heart, it does"
131,That cop should be in prison
132,"Freaking cowards, none of yall helped!!!"
133,He has no business being a public servant he should be in prison ðŸ¤¾
134,Of course the cop is black... hooligans fr
135,Too much darkness
136,The footage was fine the strong language is where it becomes offensive
137,That's why black cops should be in black neighborhoods ðŸ˜®
138,Nah nah nah don't put your gangster away cuz this ain't racism on this caseðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
139,I hate the
140,You could tell that cop was a wrong â€˜un by his socks.
141,That officer got some serious hands!!!!!
142,"sometimes actions arn't made because of a system, most of the time in fact these kinds of things happen because the cop just wanted to."
143,Notice how the other cop tries to stop his colleague from beating the guy
144,"I dont understand what the officer did wrong, he was forced to defend himself against a violent vile human being."
145,0:09. We really do not like seeing cops using excessive force!ðŸ˜

151,50 year old acting like a 21 year old going no where in life
152,"Remember when cops carroed bog ole black billy clubs and they would bist your head. I do , and im white. Yahh that was part of my white privledge to git thumped by one when i was an idiot. Then my white privledged earned me an elevster ride at the old 4th avenue jaoll in downtown phoenix , and i believe most you folks kno what happens in an elevater . Yes the white guy falls againts the walls of the elevater multiple times amd also slips and falls against many fists and then is charged with assaulting an officer. I used to jate them complimentry elevater rides"

161,"Hahaha man best thing about being a cop, is probably getting down with some scraps â€œfull respect after taking a few licksâ€ definitely wouldnâ€™t want to press extra charges if I were to agree to the fight."
162,LOL that's Seattle for you

168,Just proof that jay inslee has pussified the police in seattle
169,I noticed that guy running had big bruises on his side stomach dont they have mental health workers to work with the homless on streets .?
170,That in my court room would be 5 years mandatory.
171,I cant breathe!!
172,"We need to stop disobeying authorities and using race cards, police do their jobs and suspects fight back that they have to use extra force and it does end well and who is to blame? Cops, itâ€™s ridiculous"
173,He's much better at pretending to know how to fight than actually fighting
174,You voted for this Seattle.......Enjoy the smell in the barn you built.
175,Seattle police have the criminals and the politicians to fight
176,This city is like watching Batman were criminals just run the area
177,There will still be people blaming the cops for being heavy handed
178,"lmao is that what you call ""fighting"". seattle , what a ruined city. "
179,Get off his neck get off his neck ðŸ˜‚
180,"Man, you canâ€™t put the knee on the neck."
181,"Phone a 100 states or listen on the Los Angeles state. A 100 only 50 will be good, though the 50 will be bad. If 1000 police, only 500 will be good, 500 will be very bad. Thatid1878 s the way it is, and is the truth."
182,Well there's the knee on the neck.
183,You call that a fight 10 against 1?
184,yeah you cant fight them inside their house...i tried one time and i ended up exactly like that dude in the rubber room stripped naked curled up on the floor like a baby
185,Oh snap here comes that knee on the neck
186,The cop has his knee on his neck!
187,"I see pure abusers, trained to treat humans like animals, it is obvious that they use steroids, they have no empathy for life, what a shame they become worse than an animal, a tranquilizer seems more practical to me than degrading the person. God will change all this, and everyone will pay for their actions, both criminals and police."
188,"Fighting with the cops while in custody is not smart. It is never going to end well. You have a problem, you discuss it with your attorney. Only fight police in the courtroom, where you have a chance at winning."
189,"What is he thinking,4 big cops and heâ€™s in handcuffs,,they were going to let him out.what a bonehead he showed them ðŸ˜‚"
190,if he had dealt with the Russian police he would not be alive after this
191,"Only 5 years ago on the Johns Hopkins website it stated that transgender was a mental illness ,,As per all the top doctors and councelers in the world,,,,But now because the woke government put pressure on them they have changed there outlook,,,Now all of a sudden there more woman than natural born women......Apparently all the geniuses were wrong..."
192,Amazing a knee to the neck to hold him down and no problem breathing.
193,If I found someone in my car I would think they were laying in wait to kidnap me.
194,"OMG, SEE THAT ROGUE OFFICER PUNCHING HIM IN THE GUT, THATâ€™S NOT LEGAL, NOR WOULD BE GRABBING HIM WITH HIS NECK HALF TWISTED. HOW ARE THESE COPS EVEN TRAINED?"
195,These police violate peoples rights so much lol
196,"1:40 The way the sheriff said, ""YERR UNDERR ARRREST"". After the handcuffs clicked. Well done for all of our police officers."
197,"9:39 Does anyone know the outcome, if the guy actually served his mandatory five year sentence or was he let out early or did he spend more than five years in prison. Obviously he is a dangerous and violent criminal and I am glad that he was taken off the streets."
198,"To obtain a search warrant, the officer must present the case to a judge who will decide whether to issue a warrant. And I don't think the police have clean flour in the bag either, who hasn't been disobedient when you were young or older....."
199,San Berdo is now stop and frisk? I hope that pill kid got off. That's BS policing.
200,"If Biden didn't rate waste over $100 Billion to fund the Ukraine war and spent that money locally instead, these people would all be in accommodation right now."
201,"So by the quality, I would say this is probably early 2000s maybe even before that. Cops haven't moved too far from this time, from other videos I've watched. At minute 10:00, they saw some young kids walking across the street, looking around at everything. Don't know what business they have in the city, might just be kids coming into the parking lot to shop. Direct quote. So cops are oppressors. Isn't that the conclusion? What do you care, or have to care, about what some person is walking, doing in your city and what are they about? He literally added - they might be just shopping. Yeah. Yeah. They might be just shopping. :D Bro, cops in America probably have nothing to do all day and randomly pointing and some people and oh yeah, we hit the jackpot of crimes. :D Not that they have suspicion or anything before hand but yeah, look at what we got, and they are like - we are pros. We knew the whole time. :D"
202,"That blonde haired cop in the first video was a little overzealous with the arrest. Putting the guy in a headlock and punching him all the while saying ""stop resisting"" when he was the aggressor."

206,1:15 WWE? John cena
207,"Drug War exist to enrich JUDGES, COP & LAWYERs"
208,It is NORMAL human reaction to resist when violently attack so COPs act aggressively for pretext to arrest. My opinion
209,so ahole cops escalate just to arrest. My opinion
210,"1:50 the way the cop just said ""You're under arrest"" after kneeing his face into the ground while slapping cuffs on sounded so sarcastic i couldnt help but laughðŸ˜­"
211,Do people out west not know what a belt is???? Why go around pulling up their pants instead of blowing their money go buy a BELT.
212,"How are you helping saying turn away from me ,put your hands Locked on your head spread your legs . Cringe !!! The lies of a police man"
213,"Listen i wouldn't ever resist arrest but i would tense up and move around if suddenly someone came running at me yelling and caught me off guard. Sometimes i think ""resisting arrest ' is like ""i smell marijuana""."
214,I am extra drug addict and I quit taking drugs about 20 years it is not worth it to lose your life over drugs
215,"I love the ""they're not my pants"" excuse. Lol"
216,"Why is it every time cops yell into their radio â€œgot one fighting!â€, theyre the only ones punching and kicking anybody, trying to twist limbs off n stuff? Nobodyâ€™s ever punching them or trying to hurt them in any way. I donâ€™t think cops know what a fight is. If you â€œtense up on themâ€, which sometimes just means not allowing you wrists to be pushed up between your friggin shoulders, they think youâ€™re fighting. No, yâ€™all are the only ones fighting. They think youâ€™re supposed to stand still with your chin out n let them punch you in the face. And any effort made to try to minimize the injury they do to you is fighting . And they usually charge you for it."
217,Guy w the gun should get a felony charge. No excuse for that.
218,What does SHALE not be infringed mean?
219,"I swear if they don't get charged for that, and this poor dude gets charges as cool as he's been being a peacemaker I loose all faith in law enforcement that's bogus bs. No gun charges for a brother caretaking for his sibling like really wow."
220,"Having their child lives in the line, its somewhat understandable"
221,There is no situation so bad that it cannot be made worse by the presence of law enforcement.
222,Edited video leaving out the important police brutality.
223,apparently not enough police forces onsite.
224,"I'm sure that bringing a gun to a school on lockdown, running at police, and trying to run into the active treat could only end well"
225,the parents showed up and made it worst
226,do not argue with the police. Obey all commands quietly.
227,That is one loyal family. Just too bad they are defending a relative who is a school shooter
228,Idk whatâ€™s the right answer. I think I would have brought a gun too honestly if there was a school shooter at my kids school. I think they had every right to show up but I also respect how quickly the officers responded.
229,"It was a f'ing parent. 
 LMFAO... scumbags"
230,The officers here did a great job! I get that emotions are high from parents/family members but showing up with a gun to a school that has reports of a subject with a gun...that may not have been the best idea.
231,Thats some bs. He was probably packing to defend himself and his family member in the school becuase we know the cops usually choke and dont protect the kids.
232,Thatâ€™s BS. The police department is at fault. ðŸ’¯
233,"Why those cops are such p$$ies whene a gun is involved, thia is the norm in the US. Such pusss"
234,"This type of thing wouldnâ€™t happen if we actually held criminals responsible for their actions. We have so many instances of criminals escaping penalties that people now feel that they have to take the law into their own hands and protect their children, because even if the police arrest someone, they donâ€™t suffer adequate consequences."
235,"These people need to understand thereâ€™s police inside, police with a perimeter outside, and they have said thereâ€™s no shooter in the building. Get a grip the situation is under control."
236,Ghetto Hispanics!!
237,"Police have proved to us that they will let our children die before running inside the building. This is what happens when parents donâ€™t trust law enforcement. If this was my kids school, Iâ€™d be RUNNING through the doors. People will do ANYTHING to protect their babies. Being arrested for that is horrible"
238,Maybe if hundreds of police in uvalde with guns hadnâ€™t shown restraint parents wouldnâ€™t have had reason to show force.
239,Uvalde destroyed what little remaining confidence or trust most of us have in our police actually protecting children in schools.
240,"Castanada needs to go to jail, his mom needs rehab"

242,All the wack LA Families need to go back home I rent homes and employ 30 plus people I deal with 100 customers a day AND I WONT EMPLOY SELL ANYTHING OR RENT TO THEM THIS IS WHY ACTING LIKE SUPERMAN ST A FKN SCHOOL YOUR NOT TOUGH YOU GOT RAN OFF YOUR OWN STATE ðŸ˜‚
243,This guy feels he can do what ever he wantsâ€¦be respectful when interacting with police itâ€™s the right thing to doâ€¦people canâ€™t do whatever they want our whole civilization would crumbleâ€¦ppl have to follow the â€œrules/lawsâ€.
244,Whatâ€™s this trend as of late where citizens think they can tell cops â€œdonâ€™t put your hands on meâ€
245,"In a way, the family members were clearly not thinking about their kids when they decided to act out against the police which resulted in two people being arrested. Imagine being a student that was locked down only to find out later that day that your parent or sibling was arrested for their actions on school property, gosh that would be embarrassing. I understand the parents fear but they can't act out, there should've been a meetup spot for everyone. I'm surprised they were allowed to go to the front entrance in the first place, I know parents were fearful for their kids but they should know they can't exactly just walk into the school and take matters into their own hands."
246,"If an actual school shooter was there, these guys would be wasting resources, eventually increasing the chances their kids get shot."
247,So they are looking for an unknown possible shooter and the guy wants to jump a fence to go into the school? Yeah real smart.
248,How hard is it to shut up and comply?
249,Pubic Skiiiiizzzooollll... what is this world coming to? I weep for the future bit I applaud the amount of care Davis has for his family...
250,"The difference between this and Uvalde is that police showed up in a timely manner and EXPLAINED to the waiting parents that there was NO GUNMAN inside and the kids were SAFE. Don't be an ignorant leftist, jesus christ."
251,Get a good holster people
252,I donâ€™t condone their behaviorâ€¦.but you can understand how terrified parents are for their childrenâ€¦â€¦we are a country where children. Our most precious possession are murdered in their schools and the government does virtually nothingâ€¦..care more about guns than childrenâ€¦..and allow guns to get into the hands of people who shouldnâ€™t have them.
253,Well with the debacle in Uvalde can you really blame the parents? The days of waiting for you guys are done yo's
254,Specially in Arizona Where everyone is Armed of course there's going to be a response like this
255,Police are there to keep the shooter safe from the community.
256,People should start homeschooling their children. That will solve the problem of school shootings.
257,Leave it to parents and family to absolutely blow things out of proportion.
258,Why bring a firearm on school grounds? Thatâ€™s plain stupidity and he has to be revoked the license to own any firearms.
259,What on earth is wrong with people America is a frightening place if you ask me America just seems like a scary place to be that's why I can't understand how people can pay money to go on holiday there and owe my god all them police there and the geezer has a hand gun what a complete whopper little muppet I can't believe it ðŸ˜®
260,"I was gonna be on the parents and siblings side because I know they were beyond worried for the safety of their family members. I still am but not a great idea to bring a gun to a school where officers are, with guns, looking for a gunman."
261,Do all these people not have jobs ðŸ˜‚
262,What a couple of fkkn idiotsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
263,Did they ever found out who was trying to get in?
264,These people are peasants
265,Both idiots
266,"for whatever reason, dont run towards an officer hostile-y"
267,I understand your a concerned parent but don't bring an illegal hand gun numbnut. He could've been the guy trying to get in.
268,The parents should have acted more civilized tho
269,My thoughts are that I think the reason that guy had a gun was because he mabye new that he was going to go in that school to try to be a hero and get his kids
270,"If only parents were able to do this in Uvalde, perhaps the police would've manned up and gone in."
271,Hate to say it. But as a parent I would be losing my mind too. With all these shootings these days people are on edge.
272,why people have to be so irrational
273,"2:50 okayâ€¦ as someone who studies gun safety, and as someone whose family has concealed carry licenses, and they all constantly practice proper gun safety to the fullest extent, one thing you do when even NEAR a school is you donâ€™t have a weapon on person. That is one of the DUMBEST things you can do. You leave it in your car in a locked compartment, separate the magazine and secure that elsewhere in the car, and you lock your car."
274,"If my kid were in that school, I would not want fools disrupting police from doing there job."
275,The man with the blue shirt is suspecious . He was the first person on the scene.
276,Can we let the police do their job without whacked out parents interrupting?
277,Im kinda sorry but some of these parents look like they do meth.
278,Why does he call the cop a bro? Is that his brother?
279,Way to actually make it unsafe for your children people..
280,"If my son is in there, I don't care I'm getting into the school even if I have to shoot someone to get them out my way."
281,The matter of fact the guy in the blue shirt was always pressuring he was pressuring a lot for some reason it was suss and he had a gun and you can own a gun with he's like 22 so he like on a gun but you pressuring stuff you're going like to get into school even though they said it's safe it's like go it's like really sucks because if you did when they go into the fence they actually
282,I understand not letting people in the school. If they let one they have to let everyone and next thing you know the killer has entered the school. Or an unruly fool like this guy with the gun has entered. Police did the right thing here.
283,shoot dem foolz
284,This is exactly what happens when police officers betray the trust of We The People Iâ€™m looking at you Uvalde PD
285,It's sad this is what the world has come to.
286,I understand parent are shaken...but you also have to understand police are trying to right the wrongs.
287,Iâ€™m sorry but the worst thing you can do in this situation is take a gun to the school while officers are already there
288,"Great, now families are going to be the problem. Theyâ€™re creating a bigger issue. They all think they are the most important person out there and that they have the right to interfere. Dang!"
289,"Hey, Uvalde cowboy hat wearing pussies, this is how you handle a school shooting situation"
290,"Bringing a gun in this situation, is like bringing a gas can to burning building ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£"
291,"1st thing. AWESOME response time by officers! They secured the scene. My question is though, why were all the parents not informed better of what was happening and why wasn't a perimeter set up for them not to approach the school like this? This could've been the perfect storm for a gunmen who really wanted to inflict pain that day. Too much chaos and confusion!"
292,"friendly reminder that cops have no legal right to ""protect and serve"""
293,maybe the cops should let the family members inside once just to see what happens
294,"Bro, not the time to joke about Ohio. There are kids that lost there lives in Ohio from school shooting. I had a kid that died in Ohio from a school shooting. Got shot."
295,"People these day making joke about""only in ohio"" while innocent kid dies these people doesn't even care"
296,"Cant even go to school in Ohio ðŸ’€ 
 But in all seriousness, great job responding to the situation, great how you handled the situation!"
297,"Sad thing is, it's hard to tell if this isn't some convoluted police PR stunt trying to save face, or just another day"
298,Funny how the school police officer barely turn on his radio to listen to the call just imagine if it wasnâ€™t a false alarm.
299,This should be used as a training/disclaimer video to show police officers how theyâ€™re supposed to respond to an active shooting call rather than waiting outside and sanitizing their hands.
300,"Iâ€™m glad to see thereâ€™s officers in Ohio that will openly go into danger without hesitation, but it also is annoying asf to see that itâ€™s a false call, due to someone squatting the school."
301,I can't help but think that they already knew that it was not real just so they can flex to make up for the Texas shooting. I wouldn't put it beyond anybody to do something like that. I'm sorry if nobody here's my opinion about it.
302,"Lock these fools, that are making these calls, up."
303,"People who make swatting calls, need to be charged with attempted murder."
304,Uvalde needed these types of cops
305,A hacker wanted to test the time!! I bet you money
306,Thos who call fake school shootings should get life in prison
307,"Now that's a breath of fresh air these cops aren't scared like some cops when it comes to calls like this or another type of call, it was a fake call but they didn't know that at the time an they ran right in boom that's how Ohio does it baby not scraed there."
308,How did nothing come through on the SRO deputy radio?
309,Itâ€™s almost like they know better than to stand around sanitizing their hands for half an hourâ€¦
310,"Oooh , here come the rough and tough guys with guns ."
311,"You would think one of the first calls would be to the SRO at the school who is clearly on a different radio channel. The fact that all these officers had time to respond and the SRO was in the school the whole time oblivious to the call, hoax or not, is a huge issue."
312,theyll never get credit for this but good job anyway
313,Clearly not uvalde cops
314,clearly not Texas officers
315,"these cops are all; ""THIS ISNT UVALDEEEEE!"""
316,The metal detector let's me know that this must be a great educational facility lol.
317,"In an actual shooter scenario the 911 operators will receive multiple calls from multiple people. In a false call they will just get the one call. By the time the police arrive, they pretty much know if it's real or not."
318,Make sure you're always on alert. This might have been a test for if the person plans on doing the real thing and they need to know your response time. It's sad that it might actually be true. I pray it doesn't happen. Thank you police for being there without hesitation
319,"If nothing else, it makes for a good training exercise. Hopefully they don't get complacent though."
320,They did not hesitate. Great Job Heros!
321,Whoever called that in needs to be hung in the center of town to set an example for decades to come.
322,At least they actually rushed in instead of waiting outside for an hour while the shooter kills everyone.
323,Whatâ€™s BEEF?
324,AFRAID. Just how they roll
325,"This guy was well known, as well as his situation and potential threat, yet it was completely ignored. The system failed."
326,Cowards
327,"This is the Ar-15 effect. Cops are trained to go into danger but they're also human and don't want to be cut in half if confronting a shooter with a weapon of war.
 I know, I know... the Ar-15 isn't exactly a weapon of war, but it is modeled after the M-16 which certainly is a weapon of war.
 On the one hand, the cops are not doing their duty but on the other hand, I can commiserate."
328,Thats there job to confront dangerous situation. They should have removed his guns. This is because men always minimize everything.
329,"Yt privilege ðŸ˜‚ they have the nerve to try to scare us of a threat from hamas and south of the border, Iâ€™m more concerned about white homegrown terrorists than anyone else"
330,If you listen closely it sounds like tom's yell.When his fingers get slammed in the piano.
331,He was driving a Kia Sorrento.
332,"When someone yells and screams after being shot, they are in some serious pain, because 90% of gunshots, you don't even feel"
333,I love it when you cant tell if its police sirens or the women screaming bloody murder on the top of their lungs like a chimpanzee on fire.. smh.
334,2 hits... how many lawyers attched to those misses???
335,Chris Rock has a great video on how NOT to get shot by the police. Please review it.
336,"Criminal doing criminal things: Wears hood, runs from store when told to stop, is a felon with a stolen gun. He asked for it. Heâ€™s not doing medical research to help children, heâ€™s not on his way to churchâ€¦heâ€™s ASKING to be shot - and he got SHOT! Thank God for the officers. Please take my tax money. Better than sending it overseas."
337,"Imagine u are the ""MAN"" cause u are carrying then u scream like cat when u got shot."
338,Cops do get heavy. Sometimes they need to back down slow down and re-evaluate.
339,40k a year isnâ€™t worth your life or even the life of the criminal.
340,Cops are being held hostage as props for their state pretty much. Not all but some. Be careful of moles.
341,Race relations? Those are the type of comments that make things worse. And felon? So they did their time? The. All rights reserved or given back. Cali is exempt because murders only do 10 there. Max.
342,Nice diary entry lol. These idiots taking orders from the same people trying to exterminate us.
343,"And sorry, but this slow ass approach to arrest that fucker is ridiculous. You all were just in a super quick altercation, move in and cuff dudes. Wtfâ€¦ I understand the risk, but this point you have the advantage! Use it! Unless you truly want people to die I guess"
344,"I was going to say good discretion, until he said that he has a gun. Which I imagined he already knew..How about, suspect is shooting. Or something more specific than the bullshit â€œshots firedâ€."
345,"After watching so many of these videos on this channel, it always amazes me when people are still upset about these kind of police interactions. It also amazes me that noone seems to realize that almost every single one of these could be avoided if the perp simply did not actively resist against the cops. Don't run, don't fight, don't try to shoot them. Fight your battles in court and you live to see another day."
346,"He dropped the teaser, he didn't put it away."
347,"We live in a society where a dude can be warned dozens of times, pull a gun out and then its the cops fault according to fucking morons"
348,It took me a while to realize the mouthy woman was upset about the officers shooting someone. I first thought she was upset that the officer at 3:05 shot across the parking lot with people in their cars and possibly walking in the lot.
349,No! Not again. YouTube censorship.
350,The pay raise moment was amazing ðŸ’€ get this kind gentleman his 25 bucks
351,From the screaming I think getting shot hurts.
352,He was on the ground hahah and then he cried hahah
353,"They had every reason to believe that he still had his weapon if they saw him toss it that's one thing or if he walked out from between the cars with his hands empty and up that's one thing but he didn't do either of those things so you know what they say play stupid games, win stupid prizes or as my family would say whatchu learn fool?"
354,Non of the officers saw him ditch the gun they all assumed he still had the firearm on him.
355,I love when people start shouting their opinions in the middle of a situation that they know nothing about
356,What the f*** did that family member think was gonna happen? That was a basket of idiocy carried by a village dunce.
357,"Discarding their weapons doesn't undo what these violent criminals did. He earned every bullet hole he got for his poor life choices and complete disregard of the innocent lives he got involved. He's nothing but fortunate that he didn't lose his life, and ideally should be locked up for at least a decade."
358,First 2 shots seemed to be pretty reckless
359,Oh no my gun toting criminal bf got shot....losers.
360,people are so fucking stupidðŸ˜… now what if he started shooting at u and your family
361,"'Get on the fucking ground''
 
 Suspect: **already on the ground shot**
 Logic: ðŸ˜ðŸ˜"
362,Thank God I didnâ€™t scream like him when I got hit in the back when some dick head tried to rob me ðŸ˜­. He didnâ€™t get anything & almost died to so we even
363,I thought they don't shoot unarmed white guys. Must have left his white privilege in his other methhead costume.
364,Ah yes. Always a hysterical screaming woman to count on in a pinch
365,can I get a translation on 3:15? also who was it? sounded like it was right into the mic.
366,"You Tube had this hidden behind a ""are you sure you want to watch this-contains violence"" button. I reckon they don't want you to see the black criminal get shot???"
367,This cop military trained bey
368,The screaming woman needs to shut the fuck up.
369,The screams in pain make me smile.
370,"Lol he acts all hard, when his ass gets filled with lead, heâ€™s screaming like a little bitch"
371,That cop got down on em
372,His Family are Such Enablers He Runs Around With a Gun Goes back to The Car they Are Fine With His Disgusting Coward Behaviour Until a Cop Shoots Him then they start Crying Saying Defund Police Etc itâ€™s Absolutely Pathetic
373,"Ladies, (And gentlemen I suppose), if you ever bear witness to something like this and you don't know what's going on, don't be THIS lady.. lol."
374,There is no doubt in my mind that these officers did the right thing.
375,Oh my goodness. Women are so emotional. It's annoying
376,He did nothing. Has a stolen gun. But yeah nothing.
377,"Multiple felon. Stolen gun. Runs from cops. Ditches gun while hiding from cops. 
 
 Family mad he got shot. That family is totally messed up."
378,"Its nuts that someone clearly doing something wrong, is able to have backing and sympathy. Makes me think of that meme where ""hes a good boy he didnt do nuffin"" I get its a family memember, BUT he is and hyas legit DONE WRONG AND RUNNING. to hell with those people trying to make the aggressor seem like the good dude. Whenever a family tries to sue over something like this, it just screams to me they are desparate for monies. FUCK thos people too. they are in that situation because they rely on others way too hard"
379,That's my home town. Don't see a lot of crime there.
380,Did he pull his gun?
381,Hurrr de durrr he dropped his gun so heâ€™s innocent of the crime! ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤
382,"""get on the fuckin ground"" an entire second after dude face plants on the pavement lol"
383,Criminal with deadly weapon: âœ…ï¸ police doing the right thing: âœ…ï¸ Stupid lady screaming who has no idea whats going on: âœ…ï¸
384,â€œYou shot me two times bro!â€ ðŸ˜‚
385,Police had MULTIPLE reasons to shoot him.
386,They had every reason to shoot.
387,Just by the way he acted when he got shot showed him a lesson.
388,Lol the family tries to defend their thug family member because he didnâ€™t have the gun in his hand any more when he was shotðŸ˜‚ the dude literally pulled it out while being chased by the policeâ€¦you pull a gun while police are chasing you youâ€™re getting shot sorry not sorry bud.
389,"ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£I'm dying as the cop tells him to ""Get on the f**king ground!!"" after pelting him with five rounds and watching him writhe and scream on the f**king ground. Hilarious!"
390,Of course the wonderfully responsible family should be upset that the nasty police shot their upstanding boy scout career criminal. I'm sure they are proud that their boy will will steal and kill as their contribution to a dangerous society. They will be Dems for sure.
391,What was the cop who had the taser shooting at..... innocent people in cars.... Perp was LONG Gone.
392,"it's republican domestic terrorists like Matt walsh who told his followers to attack the hospital, way to do 0 actual journalism."
393,"Definitely a leftist threat or lie to try to pin on Lib OfTikTok. The left support the best riots that murdered people, Antifa riots who murdered people, all the people murdering right now they want released and to not serve jail time. They support the firebombing of Christian pregnancy crisis centers and of course the murder of millions of babies in their mothers wombs. Yeah, itâ€™s the left who love death and destruction so nice try."
394,"If you're ever threatening a children's hospital for any reason, you're the bad guy."
395,"We need to save the children! What should we do? I know, let's bomb a children's hospital!"
396,Sick psycho bastards bomb threats
397,â€œWe are all domestic terroristsâ€- CPAC
398,"Oh, you mean transphobes who regularly joke about trans kids committing suicide actually want trans kids dead? Wow, Iâ€™m so shocked!"
399,Check all the closets for a gun stash.
400,What type of monster would bomb a place with children?
401,I remember at a previous address I was living in they had to evacuate people from their houses because one guy in his house had cut the gas pipe and was threatening to blow his house up. To make the situation even worse his neighbour had a home made illegal fireworks factory next door in their house.
402,They walk in danger when saving others 
403,St Annâ€™s needs carpet bombing!
404,Lol so now u can't make fun of wanting trump dead?ðŸ¥ºðŸ™„
405,"Is there a difference between ""I want to k*ll the *********"" and "" IF the ********* gets assass*nat*d, I wouldn't care""? Threat wise. Thanks."
406,"Iâ€™ll start a go fund me page! Seriously, the day it happens, I have a bottle of bubbly waiting to be popped."
407,I can't believe he's arresting people you know there's a billion people that would kill him they all want to kill him
408,"Tf? Most ppl threaten trump, wtf you chasing the man like he got 5 stars on him lmao ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™‚ï¸"
409,Why they donâ€™t arrest all the Hollywood people that want to kill Trump as well?
410,"I know this was over a year ago but this goes to show U how Psychotic & Dysfunctional our Country is today & by the way this is not freedom of speech when U say these words of Threatening to Kill a person especially on F*** Twitter or any other online social media, man or woman running for The Presidency ðŸ˜’ ðŸ˜ !!!!!!!!"
411,I thought tump would be dead by now tbh
412,everyone say u will kill donald trump it's not like we're going to priso
413,Idiot man trying to kill an idiot president
414,And this is exactly why you don't joke about killing someone
415,but if someone threats me its legal and ok cause im a civillian!?
416,Arrested for tweeting to assisinate the successor of the presidency but can't find any thing to charge a cop who kills an unarmed black man

She downplays the deep-rooted racism and the chauvinist-nationalism issue in Israel. Bari Weiss is not really known for neutral journalism. Has she ever interviewed a pro-Palestinian female journalist from Gaza? No. 
 She actually protested against pro-Palestinian academics and intellectuals, she participated in Cancel Culture, Cancel Culture targeting Palestinians and their allies."

,"Maybe people should know what kind of town Dimona is. It is not only ""more right-wing"", it is the center of zionist hybris which contains a top secret zone around Israel's illegal-under-international-law nuclear weapons factory which resembles a permanent threat and provocation to the surrounding countries of the arab world and which secures the illegal-under-international-law occupation of palestine. Most people who live in Dimona are connected to the nuclear research center in one way or the other. And as of that, you simply CAN'T be antizionist when you live in Dimona. And you can be sure that authorities will do everything to ensure everyone involved will stay in line. Lucy Aharish is an isolated case in Israel. As isolated from palestinian arab life as she grew up in zionist Dimona. And this is how her story could become true."
,This woman has a great heart but she has a great disconnect from the reality that faces the middle east.
,Hope she will open her eyes and see muslims hate JEWS and they want to destroy Israel you would be considered a treator by Muslims or they will would kill you in some Muslim countries especially for marrying a JEW they would never except that or ALLAH and your not wearing a hijab that is haram and according to the Quran you shouldn't even be friend's with a Jew or Christian . Her story is good but wouldn't work in majority of countries HAMAS HEZBOLLAH most Muslim countries hate JEWS and Isreal and you follow a religion that praying to ALLAH who also will not except your marriage to a JEW
,Its so sad to have read hateful words from the Quran and the origins of Islam. Im amazed how welcoming Israelis are to Muslims.

 These are terrorists act definitely, but did you ever ask yourself why is this Palestinian that is just LIKE ME is killing? did you ask why they didn't like your yellow plates??? are those people born evil?? or is it that the government protected you !!! but failed THEM?! 
 i know it is impossible for you to really speak up, but if you really think that, you need to have a new pov. that isn't where you grew up but more of where people just like you gew up. 
 you obviously have a platform. 
 
 how is it not an apartheid if you are worried about your son's education to attack his identity as a Palestinian ! 
 
 yeah thousands were murdered because of their ethnicity, armenians assyrian etc.. i don't see the world taking someone's country and kicking out indigenous in the name of sympathy. 
 
 this country hasn't existed for such a long time and YET they have murdered more than what WORLD WARS HAVE MURDERED. 
 did you ever ask yourself as a Palestinian what i could've had if Israel was not an apartheid who is killing non Israeli arabs and attacking their ethnicity since its establishment? if we coexisted and Israel actually did better job and looked at the indigenous people equally? 
 OHH WAAAW AT LEAST THEY ARE NOT ATTACKING KIDS THESE ARE SOLDIERS???????????
 so it is horoic when Israeli soldiers are defending themselves but absolutely disgusting if a Palestinian defended himself. to save his family and save his identity and everything he believes in, 
 you are correct, you don't understand what happened in October 7th. 
 the picture got clearer, that you government didn't want to do better. unless they taste what Palestinians have been bitter on for years. 
 please no ecusations of rape were correct. recorrect yourself. the haven of the jewish people is only a haven to the jewish people, it is absolute terror for others. i myself saw an Israeli strike, my grandparents were in danger because of israeli government and i live in syria. 
 
 see your privilege? that you never ever had to think for a second where would you hide your child?? tell that to the IOF who literally will search your washing machine to take your child to jail without a trial.

,The fear and the horror you feel is only 1 % of the horror and the fear which palestinian kids and mothers and civilians feel.

,"With as much hate I see coming out of Israel and the way they mock Palestinian people and laugh at the loss of images of dead babies while their parents lament, kids from a religious organization standing in front of food trucks so they canâ€™t enter- and saying they want them to die and Israeli government policy of â€œmowing the lawn â€œ,Israel is a tough nut to crack to ever get right by the Palestinian people. Their past actions are a reminder and predictive of the future. Past actions are a fairly solid indicator of how one would expect to act in the future. These are not rational, compassionate humans. One must not forget that. They are dealing with something else. I donâ€™t know what it is but certainly not normal as a human. And there are probably millions of these incidents documented just in this short period of time. Just imo it doesnâ€™t seem a normal thing to say people are animals and they all deserve to suffer and die. So how can these people be normal and approachable by those seeking peace I have no answers ?"

,"Newt Gingrich and other republicans still wont put HSBC bank to court even when its been following sharia over 13 years .
 Go figure that ... and dont claim they dont know this ... or wait republicans believe that world is pancake and 6000 year old. 
 In mid-2003 HSBC became the first UK High Street lender to offer home buying products in compliance with Sharia (Islamic) law, which prohibits the charging or payment of interest. The range now includes a bank account, home insurance policy (Takaful), and home finance."
,"Never met a Muslim who believed in Sharia Law. Pretty much every Muslim I know believes the same things I do - gender equality, rule of law of the nation (in this case Canada), democracy, etc. They almost always vote Liberal or NDP (more Left than Bernie). Honestly, Conservative values are much more ""Sharia"" than what most Western Muslims adhere to."
,Newt is only repeating what our American founders knew about Islam. Our roots come from the great English philosopher John Locke who said Muslims can ONLY live with civilized people when they first obey civil law. Any cleric and all clerics should be immediately deported for preaching Sharia. You need to assimilate or get out.

,Newt doesn't even know what Sharia is. He just hears buzz words on fox noise.
,Newt wants to revive the INQUISITION.
,"I think ""right-wing think-tank"" is an oxymoron. None of them are capable of thinking."
,"Shar'ia is so much more then what the fear monger a portray it as. When I , as a Muslim pray 5 times a day I am following Shar'ia. When I do not eat pork I am following Shar'ia. When I dress modestly and fast Ramadan....you guessed it."
,"So if I;m a white american born and bred, can I go to a muslim website and be deported somewhere else? Cause come November there is every possibility that might be a preferable thing to living in this country. Given how stupid the population at large is with Drumpfs popularity"
,"Wait -- pronouncing a word properly is pompous? And ad hominem attacks. O no, no. Gingrich is right to pronounce the word in that manner. That is how it should be articulated. What incredible ignorance by this panel. Shame on you for propagating such idiocy. I agree with many of the substantive remarks -- but that comment is blatant in ugliness and sets a poor tone for the entire conversation."
,So many stupid people in the comments section here's a news flash news flash conservatives have no idea what they are talking about they are retarded understand they are retarded
,This Newt actually has the brain of a newt.
,"Gingrich states 'If you have nothing to hide, then you should have nothing to worry about'
 
 Does he feel the same way about NSA spying? or criminal background checks for gun purchases?"
,Mike Pence still has a Blockbuster card.
,"Something tells me Newt makes money off of private prisons. It's just a guess, though."
,Remember when Gingrich ran for president he said he was going to build a moon base for people to live on and when I was established it you petition to become state.Â That's how rational Gingrich is.
,"We need to ban Islam it is a death cult and satanic. You can't be a Muslim and a American ! You have to either embrace sharia law and hate democracy you can't be pro sharia and pro democracy that is like fire and water mixing it won't happen. I believe the state has the right to shut down mosques and arrest Muslims who adhere to sharia . Islamic extremism declared war on the west and democracy we need to fight back by putting the Quran on the controlled substance list for its spread of violence, sexism, and anti Christian sentiment. I demand the hijab be fully outlawed and punishable by jail time if they do not comply we need to ban Islam and we need to do it soon!"
,Any leader that lets Sharia spread and become implemented should be assainated for a crime against their own people .
,WHAT A BUNCH OF DEMOPRATS CLOWNS
,Brookings Institute is center left.
,"Where do you begin with this?
 
 The fundamental problem with interviewing EVERY SINGLE Muslim in this country is that there are thousands, maybe even millions of Muslims in this country. They could lie to you about how they feel about their religious affiliation with Islam and how extreme they are. Especially if you are spelling it out as law to them. They could easily be like ""I am not an Extremist"" and it would make everything you do for not. Will they be using interrogation techniques like ""waterboarding?"" or will they be using other methods to get a false confession out of people?
 
 Then the problem of making it a felony to LIKE ISIS on Facebook and follow them on twitter. That is a prime way to take away people's freedom of speech and make people follow the way that YOU feel. 
 
 Meanwhile, people on the terrorist watch list are allowed to buy weapons, but they aren't allowed to follow ISIS on twitter, what kind of bullshit is that?"
,Go to /r/exmuslim and see how many actual ex muslims who live with muslim families hate Islam. You'll be surprised.
,"I think this is a harbinger of tactics, introduced by Trump, which might change the discourse significantly. Gingrich doesn't believe all that crap he first said. He is just following the Trump playbook where you say something extreme, garner a shitload of attention, walk it back the next day, and in the process get your name in people's heads and signal to your true intentions to your base. Gingrich didn't do this very artfully, but it's his first try."
,I hate these young jerks. TRUMP2016
,"Him and Trump are at least right about the problem. They just have terrible solutions.
 You guys don't even get the problem.
 You're doing an equal amount of damage as they are."
,Nice was not a terror attack. There is no evidence whatsoever that the attacker was connected to ISIS. He was an insane mass murderer with a history of mental illness. There is no excuse for using that attack to promote anti-Muslim policies since there is no evidence that he was either a practicing Muslim nor a radicalized Muslim.
,"Don't know why, but I get the feeling ISIS might haveÂ aÂ surprise in store for Trump and the GOP.Â TheÂ wrongÂ people toÂ throw a challengeÂ at given theyÂ have theÂ psychology ofÂ the ZodiacÂ Killer - playful, sardonic, sadistic. As in okay tough guy, you wanna play hard ball - lets have some fun."

 so:
 
 1.Â I can raise my kid to be one of your

 which younger minds would find just as attractive as your show.
 
 2.Â I can watch or listen to your show when
 children are present.Â This includes
 while driving, cooking, exercising, resting.
 
 3.Â That you don't minimize the time I have
 available to tune into your show.
 
 4.Â I can recommend your show to others, young

 5.Â I can discuss your coverage of topics with
 others.

 Your show seeks out
 a young demographic.Â The majority of
 jobs available today, and especially the better paying ones do not allow foul
 language.Â Cussing is not something the
 young can emulate and expect to get ahead.Â 
 It is also not something those who are trying to better their station in
 life can or should identify with.
 
 Â 
 
 You want more people
 who share your views to run for political office.Â They can't expect to win by cussing.Â I recommend to TYT, The Art of Public
 Speaking: Lessons from the Greatest Speeches in History by The Great Courses,
 available from Amazon.Â TYT setting the
 example of how to articulate its arguments in a manner that can win elections,
 be used in school assignments, be used in a conversion with anyone in any
 setting would increase the value of TYT to its individual viewers.Â It would also allow more people to become

 You praised a
 fourteen year old who won a poetry contest, for being socially conscious and
 aware.Â You stated you want more socially
 aware minors.Â By cussing on your show,
 you refuse to make yourself available as an example to them.

 refuse to set the example for the young, you are actually saying you want more

 ""There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to.

 3. He was in the process of getting a *divorce* from a woman from whom he separated two years ago and with whom he had three children, aged five, three and 18 months. He was said to have been *depressed* in recent months as their divorce was being finalized.
 4. He had recently *lost his job* as a delivery driver after he fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into four cars, and having also been involved in a bar brawl.
 5. He lived in a squalid one bedroom apartment. His neighbors described him as a 'lonely' and 'silent' man.
 6. A few days ago he was drinking with a colleague and they argued. His pal said, 'Youâ€™re worth nothing,' and he replied, 'One day, youâ€™ll hear about me.'
 7. Security sources said a huge cache of guns, grenades and 'larger weapons' were found inside the lorry, but all the *guns were fake* and the *grenade inoperable*.

,"This was a despicable act and there is a lot of people who should not have firearms. This man who killed these three people shouldn't have had any guns. I happen to have to own firearms, I shoot for recreation. So do a few of my friends. Most of us have agreed to campaign to get assault weapons banned and to make it more difficult to get handguns. We have also agreed that if/when guns are banned all together we will be the first ones in line to hand them over with a smile on our faces. But unlike most gun owners we recognize that guns do kill people and that is why people who do own firearms should at the very least be required to store them safely. Until that day though I will go to the range with my friends and enjoy the hobby that we love. I tell this story to inform people that (though we are a rare breed) there are responsible and reasonable gun owners out there. And that not all of us will back this evil man who killed for no reason just because he supports the 2nd amendment."
,"Cenk, Cenk, Cenk. Gun ownership is not by default synonymous with murderous intent. Given the number of people who legally own guns (criminals who illegally own guns are a whole issue unto themselves), if they were all as warped as this guy, there would be so many cold blooded murders in this country every year that if those murders were to happen in China their over-population problem would be eradicated in no time flat. But that just doesn't happen. So quit trying to lump all gun owners together with your sweeping generalizations and let the bad apples answer for themselves instead of trying to make everybody else bear the brunt of the responsibility with them."
,The American Taliban strikes again
,"Stuff like this is why I am glad we don't have so many guns in Canada. Sure, I mean, we have them, but not on our person. I hear the argument made that if there were no guns allowed, only the bad guys would have guns and the law-abiding citizens wouldn't. For what it's worth, the guy was likely a law-abiding citizen up until the moment he killed those people. It's not just career criminals killing people like this. 
 Cenk is right, when somebody snaps like that, it's significantly easier to grab a gun and kill somebody than it is to do it with your bare hands. They are unsafe in the hands of people with bad or quick tempers, which isn't all that uncommon in this world. The situation could have potentially been settled had the option to grab a gun not been available."
,why hate on Muslims?
,"I normally love this show... but murderers kill people. Do guns make it easier? Not really... not as easy as it is to make an explosive device and you cannot regulate those out of existence, so... I will continue to love guns and hate religion."

They turned around and ran out my back door.I live in a state where I could have just killed them, but I didn't. I had a my wife, new born son, and 6 year old daughter upstairs.

Bad crimes will happen no matter who is President, no matter how many guns you try to restrict, no matter what. In a country of over 330 million people - we actually have low murder rates.

The definition of terrorist is someone who terrorize people. Nothing to do with Islam or Muslim people in general. Because of them media as soon as the word terrorist comes up first thing everyone thinks of is Islam."
,There were much better people for Mr. Hicks to kill that these three. He should have started with himself.

,"Very difficult story to handle, very emotionally charged, but I think Cent handled it well and as objectively as he could.
 
 It is very easy to see how the presence of guns escalates volatile situations very quickly. Just recently there was that shooting in San Francisco at a gay pride parade. It had nothing to do with the event, it was just a couple of people getting into an unrelated argument and someone in the heat of the moment pulled out a gun and fired several shots, injuring an innocent bystander.
 
 Fortunately no one died, but it could've happened very easily and was completely needless. Does anyone really think a situation like that would have escalated so dramatically if that person didn't have his gun on him? The worst that would've happened is a fist fight would've broken out and some people would've gotten bruised and bloodied."
,"Why only mention Islam & Christianity? Why not Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism etc? But either way, the gun was the crucial fctor."
,"why do people lose the reasoning of a child when it comes to the gun/person model?
 
 No one is saying it's the gun's fault...let me explain it for you:
 
 When you give a child a pencil he understands that the 'condition' of the pencil will affect how he uses it.
 
 He also understands perfectly that if you take the pencil away he wont be able to use it
 
 He understands also that it takes his input to make anything happen when he actually does use it.
 
 The gun crime statistics reflect what happens when the gun/person model is used together. Not either of them on their own.
 
 Its a fallacy to suggest that people are suggesting what a gun can or cannot do on its own."

,"So the logic is, if it makes it easier to commit this crime, it should be banned right?"
,"Now Cenk, I love your show man.Â I agree with most everything you say.Â However, I do disagree with your gun comments.Â Although guns do allow people to kill easier, I just do not feel comfortable without a weaponÂ because of our untrustworthy government.Â I do not put my trust in the government to protect me.Â Although, I do not walk around with one, asÂ if I need protection from the world each and every day of my life.Â But, I do believe it provides us with sort of a buffer between the government and us.Â This might sound wacky to some.Â However, I am for gun control.Â We should force background checks, no one on medication should be able to own a gun andÂ we should be required to attend a course before we can own any weapon.Â We should not allow just anyone to walk into a gun store, pass a background check and then be able to walk out of there and murder people.Â I guess I am just curious where you stand on guns being owned by citizens.Â Do you believe in the 2nd amendment or do you believe that, like the Bible, those words should be interpreted in the time they were written; where anyone was shot for looking at the wrong person too long or the wrong way?"

,"Look , that women is not an politician or any TV anchor or well known person, She is just a general people of USA. So we can make a math about Islamophobia in america. So this is the reality of america. But do not worry trump is ready ready to Lead USA."
,"She's not mentally ill, she's just an evil racist scumbag."
,"Last time I looked, the DSM didn't have a diagnosis for woefully misinformed and racist manifestations.... Don't blame mental illness on this bullshit. Mental illness is not a catch all for this type of behavior."
,Speaking her native Language is against the law
,"Seriously Anna? 7:01 Call the cops right away? What do you think they are going to do in such a case? You have done so many videos about how they come in and cuff everybody, especially the victim, instead of asking questions. And suppose they took the wrong side as they often do? Then it would be your fault for calling them. Especially when it comes to anyone's immigration status. The woman involved could have been a citizen but someone on the train wouldn't know about her father and shouldn't take the risk. Aside from the risk of getting them brutalized."
,its so sad how retarded this country is becoming
,typical ignorant white woman that doesn't know another person's whole story
,the Iranian Assyrian woman ( Assyrian is a branch of Christianity )
,Liars!!!! Where are the videos of the non mentally challenged people attacking foreigners - oh you don't have them because THEY DONT EXIST!!!!!! TYT you are a bunch of propaganda pushing liars.
,"middle East terrorists, USA UK supported Saudia arabia and gulf arabs in Gulf war against Iraq ...."
,So now we blame everything on Trump. Nice. If she is an American citizen then she should be speaking English and none of this would of happened.
,"Do you all notice a pattern, here? Mentally ill Trump supporters. I pointed out that they were mentally ill months ago and people thought I was just ""picking on them."" I also think a lot of them are brain dead from being over medicated."
,The white woman was being attacked thats why she said it
,"""Stalkers""? Maybe she meant spiders?"
,"I believe you must engage bigotry and prejudice. Not violently but you must confront it. To go silent when someone chooses to attack you is allowing them the space and confidence to perpetuate ugly behaviors. Shame them, mock them, be non-violent but definitely not silent"
,"My neighbor also has a mental illness, and he spends all his time listening to rightwing radio, screaming ""you lying bitch Hilary"" constantly."
,Liberals abhor facts about Islam.
,"Just this week: 61 Men, women and children murdered at the hands of Islamic Terror. 28.000+ attacks in the name of Islam since 9/11.....and counting."
,I would not be surprised if these are staged or worse in this surveillance age someone has addresses of mentally ill people and get in there face
,"when i see people killing people, i call them murderers."
,Pretty sad that we can't tell the difference between a confused (and mentally handicapped) woman vs. a Donald Trump supporter. That should say something about how much we've degenerated as a country: we have to do whatever it takes to break the back of this unceasing growth of the income inequality gap. It is starving our culture.
,"so she has lost her marbles and you play the clip showing her face, THEN you give the viewers a warning not to 'go after her'. No better than Fox,"
,Ugly douchebag Fox News watching children. I had a Trump supporter tell me on Facebook that somebody made a comment about his Trump bobblehead and he was being attacked by democratic hate.
,That filthy fat piglet is horrendous to look at. that alone should be a terrorist act coming out looking like that.
,"She's mentally ill? And _conveniently_ enough, the ONLY kinds of emotions she is capable of are fear, ignorance and discrimination? And *somehow*, when the other lady told her she was a U.S. citizen, she knew she had nothing on her?
 Give me a flying f^^^ing break!!!"
,Why can we never just admit racists are mentally sound? We're never gonna fix the problem of racism until we acknowledge a large portion of the mentally sane population thinks this way.
,That talk about hate crimes involving spray paint and stuff reminds me of the time a Hispanic man outside a Trump rally approached a man dressed in a KKK outfit and ripped off his hood. It was another Hispanic man under the hood. I bet a bunch of these hate crimes are the same type of thing.
,"The woman filming obviously didn't feel endangered by the older woman. Also, I got the feeling that the recorder was pushing her buttons to begin with.."
,"Mentally with what? The only thing that would make you this way would be schizophrenic disorder. 
 
 If she's this bad, she's not receiving the proper treatment. That's the scariest part of this whole video!"
,"For decades we had only Fox News mouthing this shit, now Trump with his rhetoric has emboldened the racist mass to spout their vomit openly."
,"She looked like an african amercan woman or at least half black. Incidentally, every time I have seen racist venom being spewed, it was either a black man or a black woman. Not hispanic. Not White. Not Asian."
,Who's the Lesbian with Ana?
,"Shit! I am scared of just existing...If I am white, I am being attacked by every other race; if I am black, cops are probably gonna shoot me; if I am muslim, America is after me; if I am Latino or Asian, I will be deported. Did I cover them all?"
,"Right on, ladies. Let's not propagate hate..."
,go away YTY full lies paid by corrution and miss perception..
,"I looked her up,but couldn't find her.I wanted to tell her how sorry I am for her having to go through that.If I had been a passenger on that bus,""I would have stood up in her defense because this is soooooo much ignorance """
,Give me the id's of the thumbs down people and I will solve the problem.
,I guess all trump supporters are all mentally ill and paranoid they all act like this. she's not mentally ill she's racist and her family is covering up for her
,I guess all trump supporters are all mentally ill and paranoid they all act like this
,The first thing I noticed was that she was mentally ill....she's calling people stalkers and talking about secret meetings....classic schizophrenic
,TYT USING THE MENTALLY ILL TO GENERATE ANGLO-PHOBIA
,"In the beginning of the video, the crazy lady is complaining that the other woman is breaking the law by talking on her cell phone...and instead of apologizing, the Muslim woman challenges her and antagonizes her and sticks a camera in her face. Who is escalating this conflict? I say the Muslim woman is.
 
 So you do or don't agree with the cell phone ban law on the BART train?"
,Anna how do you justify Jimmy Dore demonizing Hillary and Obama. As a women that show discusses me. because he is so cruel and vulgar towards people particularly women he does not like.
