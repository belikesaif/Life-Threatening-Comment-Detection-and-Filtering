# Life-Threatening-Comment-Detection-and-Filtering
This project aims to develop a Python script for detecting and filtering life-threatening comments from a dataset of social media comments. The script utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis, to identify comments with negative sentiment and containing language indicative of life-threatening behavior.
